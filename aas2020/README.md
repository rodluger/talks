# Surface Maps of Stars and Exoplanets

## AAS 235

### Honolulu, HI, January 5 2020

Perhaps the simplest question that one can ask of a
distant star or planet is, "What does it actually look
like?" Even the best interferometers can only image
the surfaces of select giant and/or nearby stars, while
the direct imaging of exoplanet surfaces is all but
impossible. Fortunately, several techniques exist that
allow us to indirectly infer what the surfaces of stars
and exoplanets look like from precise photometric
light curves and high resolution spectral timeseries. In
this talk, I will touch on the mathematical theory
behind the mapping problem, including its
degeneracies and limitations. I will discuss novel
approaches to producing surface maps of stars and 
exoplanets using the recently developed 
[starry code](https://github.com/rodluger/starry), with the goals
of (1) understanding the statistical properties of spots
and other surface features on low mass stars as a
function of spectral type, (2) producing low resolution
maps of close-in exoplanets from phase curves and
secondary eclipses, and (3) one day applying these
techniques to produce maps of terrestrial planets in
the habitable zones of their stars to identify potential
oceans and continents. I will focus in particular on
two methods that maximize the Fisher information of
the mapping problem: light curves observed in
reflected light and Doppler imaging based on multiepoch 
high-resolution spectra. By decomposing
surface maps into spherical harmonics, I will show
how both problems can be tackled analytically,
allowing one to not only find the maximum likelihood
solution quickly, but also the full posterior over maps.
I will discuss ongoing work to apply these methods to
the mapping of stars and exoplanets with current and
upcoming instrumentation.
