# Toward Maps of Exoplanet Surfaces

## University of Villanova 

### Department Colloquium, September 20 2019

Perhaps the simplest question that one can ask of a distant star or planet is, "What does it actually look like?" Even the best interferometers can only give us limited information about the surfaces of select giant and/or nearby stars, while the direct imaging of exoplanet surfaces is all but impossible. Fortunately, several techniques exist that allow us to indirectly infer what the surfaces of stars and exoplanets look like from precise photometric light curves and high resolution spectral timeseries. In this talk, I will review previous approaches to mapping the surfaces of stars as well as recent results in the nascent field of exocartography. I will discuss the mathematical theory behind the mapping problem, including its degeneracies and limitations, and present a novel approach to producing surface maps of stars and exoplanets, with the goal of one day applying these techniques to produce maps of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of their stars.
